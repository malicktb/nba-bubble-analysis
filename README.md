# NBA Player Performance: Pre- vs. Bubble Analysis

This project analyzes NBA player performance before and during the 2020 season bubble to determine how the temporary break impacted key metrics. By comparing data from [NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats) and [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), the analysis explores whether the bubble benefited or hindered player performance during the regular season.

## Data Sources:
- **[NBA Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats)**: Player performance statistics before the season suspension and during the bubble.
- **[Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)**: Performance data for the 2019-2020 regular season.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Applied efficient data manipulation techniques to clean and structure datasets for analysis.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Conducted a detailed comparison of player performance, highlighting changes in major statistics such as points, rebounds, assists, and turnovers.
- **Data Visualizations**: Developed bar charts to visualize trends in player performance before and during the bubble period, showing clear declines in performance post-bubble.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visual representations of the data to reveal trends and patterns in player performance.

## Findings:
The analysis revealed that, on average, top-performing players saw a decline in most key performance metrics during the bubble compared to before the season suspension, with exceptions in turnovers, which remained consistent.

## Conclusion:
The temporary break and transition to the bubble had a noticeable impact on player performance during the 2020 NBA regular season. This project highlights how external factors, such as the season suspension, can influence athlete performance.
